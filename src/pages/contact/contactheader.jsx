               <p>Welcome to my Profile website. This website focuses in Technology, Designing, Modeling databases and Developing. This Site was design by Gustavo Miller to demonstrate posible clients, what I can do in ASP.Net Razor pages, Databases, and Applications (Web or Desktop Applications) Technology advances faster than one can learn, it is very difficult to maintian competitive. Regardless of how technology advances we need to keep on learning. For example, Windows 11 JUST came out not long ago and, companies are already seeking for people with experience! I just migrated to ASP.Net Razor MVC pages from ASP.Net coreapp 3.1 Razor pages, but the market moved to Blazor, React and Web API! But, we need to keep up</p>
