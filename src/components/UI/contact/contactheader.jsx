               <p><strong>Welcome to my Profile website</strong>. This website focuses in the experience I have in Technology, Designing, Modeling databases and Developing. Developed to demonstrate posible clients, what I can do in React, NodeJS, Express, ASP.Net Razor pages, Databases, and Applications (Web or Desktop Applications) Technology advances faster than one can learn, it is very difficult to maintian competitive. Regardless of how technology advances we need to keep on learning. Not long ago I migrated to ASP.Net Razor MVC pages from ASP.Net coreapp 3.1 Razor pages, today I have been learning React, NodeJS, Express and Web APIs!</p>
               <p>I hope you enjoy the sample applications I have published. <br/>If you have any questions please do not hesitate in sending me a message or write me an email at <a href="mailto:gustavo.miller@miller-hs.com">gustavo.miller@miller-hs.com</a> </p>
