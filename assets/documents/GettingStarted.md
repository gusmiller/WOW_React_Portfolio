# 20 React: WOW React Portfolio

## Getting Started

## Getting Started

You’ll use `vite` to build your portfolio, which will include the following:

* A single `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Navigation` component within the header that will use `Link` components from `react-router-dom` to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

* A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

**Note**: Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.

### When you would like to scaffold a new `vite` application on your own, follow these steps

1. In the command line, navigate to the desired parent folder and run `npm create vite@latest`.

    * 🔑 *Note*: This command will automatically create a sub-folder which will house your React application; you do not need to perform a `mkdir` command to create one manually.

2. Enter the desired name of your new project folder.

3. From the first list of options, select your framework; for our activities in class, we'll be using `React`.

4. From the second list of options, select your variant; for our activities in class, we'll be using `JavaScript`.

5. `cd` into your newly created project folder and run `npm install`.

    * In later activities we'll add additional NPM packages to our `vite` apps such as 'bootstrap', 'dotenv', and 'axios'.

6. Run `npm dev`/`npm run dev` and navigate to the prompted URL to see your app.

### Further customization (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your `package.json` and modify the `scripts` object so that it looks like this example:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
```

* Note the addition of the `"start": "vite"` script.

2. Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true
  }
})
```
