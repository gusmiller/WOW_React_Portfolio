## React Portfolio

For the past few weeks we have been learning about React. Myself coming from a Dot.NET Microsoft framework, it has been challenging for me. Nevertheless, I was able to understand the process and develop this application. The React Portfolio application was developed entirely using React (and other related libraries) and Vite. My goal is to demonstrate possible employers how much and quick I have learned and how quick I can develop a single-page application in react.

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. A library not a framework. It is maintained by a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.

Here is my product!
